- I set `type: module` straight away
- Nothing has been off at all with ESM octokit and top level await in a .js
- markdown-it autocompleted everything, and I didn't need the docs anywhere
- TypeScript didn't tell me when I was re-assigning to a constant. This seems like a good candidate for raising in JS.
